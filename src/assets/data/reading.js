      'Our school organized a seven-days trip around Algeria for excellent learners. The departure was from our city; we all gathered near the school with our parents waiting for the couch, but before heading there, I made sure that all the necessary items (my mobile phone, money, my food, my clothes …etc) were all well-packed. Our final destination was Tlemcen with a stop-over for 2 nights in the capital city, Algiers. ',
      ' First, we travelled to Algiers. On the first day, we went on a sightseeing tour around the city. We visited Makam Elchahid and the National Museum of Moudjahid. The latter is a masterpiece located directly beneath Makam Chahid; it aims to collect, preserve and display objects and memories of the struggle against the French colonialism. At the entrance, the guards asked us to turn off our mobile-phones; therefore, I couldn’t take any pictures of that wonderful place. On the second day, we headed to another tourist attraction which was Elhamma Garden also known as “The Botanical Garden”. At first sight, I felt like “Alice in Wonderland”; it’s so huge and there are hundreds of different plants and high trees. ',
